# JFK Project

This repository hosts a curated collection of AI-generated one-page summaries alongside the original PDFs from the 2025 release of JFK files. The project is designed to help users quickly compare documents by highlighting common codenames, locations, personnel, and other key details.

## Overview

This project provides an integrated resource where each declassified JFK PDF from the 2025 release is paired with a one-page investigative summary. These summaries are designed to make it easier to identify similarities and patterns across documents.

- **PDFs:** The original documents are available from the U.S. National Archives here: https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/release-2025
- **Summaries:** An AI agent using OpenAIâ€™s o3-mini model generated comprehensive one-page reports for each PDF.

## AI Summarization Process

The AI was given the following instructions to create each summary:

> "You are an expert investigative analyst specializing in historical documents. This text is from a recently declassified JFK file generated via OCR and may contain errors. Produce a comprehensive one-page investigative report structured with the following sections:
>
> **File Information:** State that this is a recently declassified JFK file and provide any available metadata.
>
> **Overview:** Offer a concise summary of the document's overall content.

> **Codenames:** Note any potential code names or cryptic references.
>
> **OCR Observations:** Comment on any artifacts or ambiguities due to OCR errors.
